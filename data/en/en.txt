Bartender!
Hello in there!
I want a drink!
What's all the...
Shelleen!
Cassidy!
What happened to you?
Calvary, Pinkertons...
The West has changed.
For us, business is lousy.
If we didn't have a price on our heads, we'd get out of this hole.
Why don't we have a drink for old time's sake?
"Old time's sake" means you got no cash.
Nothing doing.
Hold these for me till I get some money.
Sentimental value alone, they're worth 5 or $600 each.
Anyways, no good no more, Kid.
Nobody cares.
Remember the Herefords in Yatrona County?
Anybody for buying a round?
You'll need more than just two of us.
What about you, Jackson?
You being an Indian and all.
You just gonna go back to living off the land?
- Then it's all settled.
Wait a minute!
You got something to say about our plan?
I'm against it.
What do you think we ought to do that's fitting and proper?
Rob a train.
That butcher, Eggers, he'll take 35 head... and butcher them himself.
What about what I said?
Look, this is the Wolf City Tribune of two days ago.
"200 workingmen stand ready for work on Monday... on the largest slaughterhouse outside Chicago."
What's that got to do with a train?
Workingmen gotta be paid, right?
There's gonna be a payroll coming.
- That's maybe 1000, $2000?
- I will drink to that!
If you didn't try new things, there'd be no progress.
Build your life anew.
This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future... and letting the past eat at your heart.
They can't get us in Hole in the Wall.
We can use Shelleen's own plan for train robbery.
My plan?
That was a challenge and a matter of pride... to see that it was robbed." And so on and so on.
That plan!
The first time I ask you to do one thing for me, like rob a train...
Listen, Miss Ballou!
Some gang!
A horse-ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac... and an uncle!
Clay Boone's gang of chicken rustlers.
I'm gonna do it alone!
Hey, did we say no?
- You will?
That plan?
What in the blue-eyed world?
I'm taking a bath.
What's so odd about that?
I'm looking for the baggage car.
Well, it's the other way, man!
- Pull those drapes!
Much obliged!
More water, more water.
Come on, we got a job to do.
My word!
Hey, let me outta here!
He's alive!
We gotta let him out!
What happened?
Put up your hands!
Let me in!
- Who's in charge?
It's a train robbery.
Get along with it.
I'm trying to take my bath.
Here's the safe.
- You'll just have to use it.
- What are we gonna do?
- I told you this could happen.
What's wrong?
He won't open the safe.
That right, mister?
7 left, 26 right, 14 left.
This is more than the $2000 you said.
Nearer 40 or 50,000, I'd say.
We take this, they'll booger us forever!
Who's afraid of a little booger?
I give up!
Hand me a towel!
Let's get outta here!
The messenger seemed like a nice man.
Shelleen, it was a great plan!
Yeah, we're just like clockwork.
You sure?
I am so proud of you!
It's just beginner's luck.
- Ask him how we'll get outta here.
You darling, Shelleen!
Drinks on the house!
Everything went slicker than...
- Where are those kids?
- Ain't been seen.
Will you lend me a bullet?
I'm telling you, Cassidy... they're coming with the payroll.
It was just like old times.
Money, money, money for a rainy day!
Help me clear this table.
Where you two been together all alone?
- Losing that posse.
His uncle Jed was right on the job.
Time was I'd squeeze a pimple like you.
What's the matter with you two?
Give the old man a drink.
There's more where that came from.
We did it, Mr. Cassidy.
My gang!
It's just the beginning.
We'll wipe out Wolf City!
You help me and I'll make you rich.
"Wolf City Development."
You ever hear of Mr. Sir Harry Percival?
He owns Wolf City Development, which owns Wolf City... which lets us alone.
We don't bother them nor Sir Harry Percival, and they don't bother us.
Sir Harry Percival.
No such thing.
Some gang of cutthroats and murderers.
We whispered your names when we were kids... scared to say them out loud.
How sad.
You got old.
Count out the shares.
Give them all drinks on Cat Ballou.
What was that for?
I think we'll go to St. Louis.
City on the Missouri... end of the Santa Fe, jump off of the Oregon Trail.
Produces beef, beer, shoes... and good times.
But why?
They're where we want them.
Let's go to St. Louis.
I think I love you.
There you go, all serious all of a sudden.
You're like all the rest of them, you gotta be in love.
You're nothing like you think you are.
How's that?
Cowardy custard.
Well, I mean... when you admire a man, you just go all out.
Love is not blind.
Just throw our hats in the air.
Where else do you see it?
Right there... in those big blue eyes.
Ain't gonna get tied down with no girl.
No, I'm going.
You know, you're gonna get yourself killed.
What do you care?
I'm leaving.
I never promised to be no hero, did I?
You're no hero, so don't worry about it.
You've no right to think what you do about me.
Why don't you just go?
Bye!
What's happening?
It's ghost sickness.
It's Indian religion, see.
We believe what the gods did when they made a man crazy was... make him fall in love.
Well, that's very poetic.
With "whom."
That's another question.
What am I gonna do?
Ain't much you can do about us.
I reckon I'll see you later, ma'am.
I get a kick out of being on the winning side for a change.
Sir Harry wants his money, fast!
What do you want, Cat?
Strawn!
You know that valise of mine?
You go find it.
Get a case of cartridges from Cassidy.
We'll always be here with you, ma'am.
It'll be all right, Cat.
Everything's gonna be okay.
What's in this?
Want a drink?
No booze.
Hello, Kid.
Long time.
Sit down.
Where you been keeping yourself?
You want a job?
Some money?
Not money and not a job...
What then?
That!
There never was any love lost between us.
Well?
I can't.
Why not?
A gunfight.
Oh, it was just swell!
Just the way I figured it'd be.
So when I walk in, I gab with him.
I figure to call his shot when I turn my back.
How that booze will do your mind!
Fog your mind so you can't remember a darn thing.
It was just fine.
You and Strawn use to play when you were children?
He was my brother.
It's like that time in Tombstone when he made me walk... stripped down to only my long-handles and my hat.
I took him just like the dime novel says.
It was just fine.
!
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.
Half of Wolf City's on the way up here.
We'll take them like the last time.
Now they got 50 of that Englishman's goons, and more are coming!
Are you sure it's him?
That Englishman wants a fight?
We'll give him the biggest gunfight ever.
He wants to die!
It'll be history.
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.
It's better than dying in some dirty hotel.
I always feared dying in the gutter with a bellyful of booze.
Then Cat came along.
There's still places I want to see and things I want to do.
I don't want to die.
Let's go to St. Louis.
You don't ever change, do you?
Or any place!
You afraid someone will see you with me?
I'll even marry you!
Why do men think marriage is the only thing we want?
I've been studying on it.
Come on now, Steel Eyes.
And you, all the time laughing at me.
Silly old man looking after that young thing.
- I'm gonna see you do the right thing.
Guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs... all the same to me.
Don't listen to her!
Marry her!
I'm telling you, she won't marry me!
I'm gonna straighten you out once and for all!
What was that for?
Everybody else did it.
I got a right to, without regard to race, creed or color... according to the 14th Amendment.
Can I have my store back, now that she's going?
Sir, a consolation from the town.
Sir Harry Percival, I presume?
Delightful!
You like our wide open spaces.
I'm getting frightfully healthy, you know.
It's just simply gorgeous!
Simply gorgeous.
Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
Look at that!
A painting on the ceiling.
Yes, that's a Tintoretto.
I think it's even more gorgeous than the girl above Paige's bar.
And that's the most gorgeous thing I ever saw.
My name's Trixie.
Oh, Trixie!
May I offer you something to drink, Trixie?
Champagne, Hansen!
They told me you had a wine cellar, but I didn't believe it.
Hardly a cellar.
A bin actually, in the pantry.
I never did see a train like this before.
This is the master bedroom.
Do you approve?
Oh, it's swell!
A regular Tintoretto.
Do you like the bed?
Oh, do I like the bed!
That will be all, tonight.
A little wine with music.
Nineteenth century science...
My wallet is in the top drawer.
You won't get away with this, Trixie.
My name isn't Trixie, Sir Harry.
So you're Cat Ballou.
Sign this.
What is it?
A confession that you hired Tim Strawn... and are responsible for my father's murder.
Sign it!
And if I refuse to sign it?
I'll kill you.
Now why do I doubt that?
I don't think you have it in you, Miss Ballou.
Give me that gun.
Well, it's time.
Come on, don't just dawdle.
Everybody's waiting.
Waiting?
Looking forward to it, I might say.
I'm sorry they don't like me.
You can't blame them, can you?
Killing Sir Harry put the kibosh on the whole slaughterhouse, right?
You took the bread out of half the mouths of Wolf City.
Hallelujah, brothers!
I am here to comfort the sinner and return the stray lamb to the fold.
Let them what's troubled, what's vexed of mind, take heart.
It's a better world, we're all bound for.
Green pastures await the tired sinner, and honey flows like water.
What a time for you to fall off the wagon.
Look at your eyes!
What's wrong with my eyes?
They're red, bloodshot.
You ought to see them from my side.
We're counting on you.
If you have any last words, say them now.
Let's get on with it.
By the authority vested in me, this hanging will proceed.
Where's Shelleen?
Well, our story now is through
We'll say farewell to Cat Ballou
Come on, man.
Okay.
Let's see you cut that.
You're just not ready for me yet.
Don't you know it.
- Oh, a three.
Our lucky friend from Baton Rouge gets a big fat queen with his pair of sixes.
Dealer's flush.
Well, that broke that up.
Go ahead, bet your sixes, buster.
Told you not to call me that.
One-seventy-five.
And cost you 194 fish.
Hundred-and-ninety-four fisheroos to you, friend.
You gonna bust everybody, or am I?
- Call.
What do you mean, call?
I think you're trying to buy it.
Eights.
What, are you guys blind or something?
What do you mean, buster?
I think somebody's been daubing these cards.
Are you crazy?
He ain't gonna put out 194 bucks on a lousy pair.
You did.
I'm saying you've been marking these cards.
I don't need marked cards to beat you, pal.
Stay here.
I'll take care of him.
Give me the money.
Drop it.
- What's his name?
- Tricky Bob.
Here you are, Tricky.
Raleigh Hotel, please.
Mr. Howard, sir.
Welcome back to New Orleans.
Mr. Howard.
Hey, King Kiddo.
- Ain't my game, Eddie.
How they running, Philly?
They've been running right by me all day, Kid.
Seventeen to you, Philly.
Well, I'll give you my definitive answer to any inquiry along those lines... as soon as I see Whitey's hole card.
I call.
Aces up.
I don't believe that beats three fours, do it?
- What you got on me, Kid?
- Got you for 110, a 60 and an 85.
I'll take the 110, the 60.
You take the 85... and put it back in your bank.
Thanks, Kid.
Hello, Shooter.
- Where you been?
- Across the river.
- Do any good?
- Couple hundred bucks.
Hey, you know there was a guy in the game that accused me of juicing the deck?
Playing with amateurs, huh?
Haven't I told you you're gonna get your melon opened?
It was the only game I could find where I wasn't holding markers on somebody.
It may be just a rumor.
You know how these things get started... but they say that Lancey Howard is in town.
They say Lancey Howard?
The man himself.
The Kid will have to play him.
Mark it.
Yes, Mr. Slade.
I understand that stud poker is your game.
Well, your stakes are my pleasure, sir.
Well, why don't we make it about... lunchtime.
That's a fine idea, Mr. Howard.
My pleasure, sir.
And do remember me kindly to your charming wife.
Yes, I'll do that.
Mr. Howard, one thing more.
That's excellent.
Excellent.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Don't touch me.
Just a wee bit more Tabasco.
Yeah, this game's been coming for a long time, hasn't it, Kid?
Too long.
Think so?
He laid me out, strung me up and then...
Kid, I mean, he gutted me.
Yeah, you told me, Shooter.
Just wait till he's looking down your throat, that's all.
You're one of the greatest stud players I've seen.
But then again, so was Lancey Howard.
It's not gonna be like sitting down with me and Doc Sokal.
You see, I've been where I'm going.
You think you were ready when you sat down with him?
I thought I was the best stud-poker player in the world.
I'm telling you, I thought I was the best.
I got something, Shooter.
You know I've got something.
But you've got to remember that he's the man, see?
He's got an awful lot to protect.
He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you.
I don't want any lesson, Shooter.
I want everything he's got.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You cold?
- No.
What happened to your coat?
I ripped it.
What'd you do today?
Oh, went to the movies.
And it was all in French.
- What?
- What was the movie about?
It was about this town in Europe, and they get this message...
- Do you wanna hear this?
Well, this Spanish general had sent the message that he's coming... to spend the night with his army.
Who?
Well, the ladies... with the Spanish army.
I won't tell it anymore.
- No.
You won't believe this.
Oh, yeah?
Anyway, come morning... the soldiers go off, and everybody's happy.
Yeah, and the husbands are happy.
Yeah, husbands, fathers, everybody.
Well, how come?
Well, because that makes sense.
The point is that what good is honor if you're dead?
Hey, what the hell are you going to Frenchy movies for, anyway?
Shooter's wife wanted to go.
- Melba?
- Since that game in Corpus.
- Melba.
- I know.
Well, you should.
I happen to like Melba.
Do you have to cheat at everything?
At everything?
Look, you're just cheating yourself.
Don't you understand?
You've ruined the puzzle.
Now, that doesn't go in there.
It does now.
Why should I answer?
Oh, yes.
William Jefferson Slade.
Local celebrity, I understand.
Comes from one of the richest families in the state.
Yeah, that's right, Lancey.
Seems that your reputation is one of the few... stable things in a world of crumbling values.
I'll be there.
Would you really wear a thing like that?
Hey, I bet you'd look good in one too.
Come on.
Well, now where are you going?
You ever been to the Turkish bath?
Well, then, come on and find out.
The Turkish bath leaves nothing to the imagination.
But I wouldn't know what to do in a Turkish bath.
But that's what's so marvelous.
Well, you and the Shooter are married.
Now, that's something.
It's nothing.
You know you got somebody that wants to spend the rest of his life with you too.
How'd you like to spend the rest of your life with Shooter?
Least you know how much you mean to somebody.
Last card.
Possible flush.
Pair of eights.
Nothing there.
Pair of queens.
Possible flush.
Queens check to the possibles.
Two thousand.
Two and up two.
Fold.
Fold.
I fold.
This Cincinnati Kid, he wants a game, huh?
That's the biggest pot yet.
Call the two thou.
Queen high.
- Jack high.
Can you beat that?
- He just did.
Hello.
- Dallas or Tulsa?
Probably both.
How the hell did you know I didn't have the king or the ace?
I recollect a young man putting the same question to Eddie the Dude.
"Son," Eddie told him, "all you paid was the looking price.
Lessons are extra."
- Here, Lancey.
- Thank you.
You gonna play the Kid?
But I think you'll enjoy his game.
I may admire it... but if what I heard is true, I doubt I'll enjoy it.
Come on, the tougher the competition, the better you used to like it.
Well, what are we waiting for, Shooter?
Well, I do declare, Christian.
It's that three-river gambling man, the Cincinnati Kid... getting himself all shined up.
You'll never guess where we've just been.
Stag movies?
Big news?
Some say he's gonna be the man.
Or didn't you know, Christian?
See you around.
- Double or nothing.
- Call it.
Heads.
Let's get something to eat.
I didn't know you were thinking about going home.
When are you going?
There's a bus that leaves tonight.
Unless you wanted me to stay.
Until morning, that is.
Well, are you coming back?
Well, you never even asked me why I was going.
Well, why are you going?
You don't want me... around your neck.
Not now, anyways.
Well, I never said that.
Listen, Christian... after the game...
I'll be the man.
I'll be the best there is.
And that's what I'm gonna be, Christian.
I know.
I'm all packed.
Six stacks.
Is that right, Shooter?
Six.
Well... we've been playing 30 hours.
That rate, 6000, that makes roughly... two hundred dollars an hour.
Thanks for the entertainment, gentlemen.
I'm particularly grateful to Lancey here.
It's been... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work.
Thank you for the privilege, sir.
Well, you're quite welcome, son.
A pleasure to meet someone who understands that to the true gambler... money is never an end in itself but simply a tool, as language is to thought.
Good evening, Mr. Howard.
No, look, Slade...
I can't make it tonight.
I'll see you tonight.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Quincy-6859, please.
How about if she'd go with you and Christian?
Did Lancey go for it as a game setup?
Yeah.
- Look, Shooter...
- I promised her.
You know how it is.
Well, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks, Kid.
I'll meet you at my place after the fight.
Well, Lancey, are we all set for Monday night?
Long enough to think of her almost fondly.
- How's she doing?
- She's down.
She busted out in a Vegas faro game.
- Well, I guess that's it, then, huh?
- And may the best man win.
That's how it usually comes out in the long run.
Oh, Shooter... tell me... is this young man of yours gonna give me any trouble?
Well, I hope it isn't gonna be one of those marathon games.
- Not anymore.
- Like the session we had in St. Louis?
- Remember?
The longest game I ever played was on the maiden voyage of the Mauretania.
Bishop's Rock to Ambrose Light without a stop.
Six days.
Lancey... you have been the man for a long time.
That is undoubtedly true.
But don't let that fool you.
I'm not ready to retire yet.
Thank you.
Do we have to sit with them?
Sit where you want to.
Come on, Jessie, move over.
- Where's the Shooter?
Working.
She went home to mama.
Didn't She, Kid?
Don't lose no sweat, Kid.
Mine left me too.
I wonder why.
Who you trying to kid, sister?
Get ready.
Let's go out to the car.
Why don't you relax.
- To lose.
Looks like you're gonna owe us some money, fat boy.
Alice Lee, honey, would you like to freshen up Mr. William's drink a little bit?
- A little more bourbon, Mr. William?
- Thank you, Mrs. Slade.
Honey, why don't you go out to the kitchen and bring us some of those... fancy little hors d'oeuvres.
Why, that's exactly what I was about to do, sugar.
I declare, Billy, sometimes I think you got psychic powers.
She's a real lady, Mrs. Slade.
That little gal means more to me than the whole wide world, Shooter.
Well, she's fine.
Just fine.
Yeah, she's a nice girl, Melba.
Girl of quality and taste.
Expensive tastes, I would imagine.
- Well, I guess you might say that, yes.
- Well, that's as it should be.
That's one of the great feminine characteristics.
Taste for fine things.
That's when they start to drift away.
You know this game that you're dealing for Lancey and the Kid, you know?
There's an awful lot of interest developing in that game.
Betting interest, that is.
What would you figure the odds to be, Shooter?
Well, I'd say the New York money will probably lay about... oh, 8-5 on Lancey.
Personally, I think the Kid's chances are better.
- Well, I don't think I'd wanna bet on it.
Lancey Howard is an old man, Shooter.
He's ready for a fall.
Trouble is that the Kid might be nervous, big game like this.
Say in the neighborhood of $25,000?
I could never do anything like that.
Of course you couldn't.
That's why they chose you to give them a fair deal.
It's out of the question, Mr. Slade.
Maybe two or three hands at the right time.
Oh, Melba would be mighty proud of you if you won yourself $25,000.
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Slade.
- You gave me two years to pay them.
You know when I realized that?
When I saw you hesitate about accepting that $25,000.
That's right, boy.
You just think that over.
- Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven, if memory serves.
It's for my kind of money.
I wanna see that smug old bastard gutted.
- I'm gonna be...
Lookie here, Cora-Anne and Billy-Bob... come to say good night to their daddy.
Well, now, my cottontail bunny rabbits.
- I know all those stories.
Well, are you aware of the circumstances on which she left Shreveport, Louisiana?
Yes, I'm aware.
It's a story that deserves to be told.
Now, listen carefully, children.
Once upon a time... down in Shreveport, Louisiana... there was this bad little girl named Melba Nyle.
Relax.
Shooter will be along.
All that dust at the pit.
I always feel so dirty after one of those things.
Brings out the best in you, Melba.
What does that funny little country gal bring out in you?
See anything you like?
About the dance, I mean.
Now, don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend.
- That's right.
- He's mine too, honey.
Next you're gonna say he's like a father to you.
Yeah?
Oh, hi, sugar.
Well, then you won't be home for a while.
Eight o'clock Monday, apartment 2A at the old Lafayette.
Yeah.
Yeah, she seemed to have a pretty good time.
Yeah, she's a fun girl.
Yeah.
You bastard!
I hope you lose.
Thanks, baby.
Day after tomorrow at the old Hotel Lafayette, 8:00.
Yeah, you better let him know.
They gonna be full up, from what I hear.
Same to you.
You know who that was, Kid?
- No, not today.
There's gonna be a lot of money in town.
Hey, how's it going?
Hoban tell you about Yeller?
Yeah, I was just telling him.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Kid.
Hey, what's wrong?
Jack Doyle's laying 12-5 on Lancey.
- There's plenty of money on you too.
I'll see you later, Shooter.
Hey, Kid!
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Kid.
- Hi.
This is a surprise.
I just came by to see how you were doing.
Mama, this is Eric.
How do you do, Mrs. Rudd?
Howdy.
No, I had something to eat in town.
Come on.
There's some hot biscuits in the warmer.
Come on.
I used to come here and play when I was little.
I'd dream, mostly.
Oh, just things that little girls dream about.
There was a story I heard... about a wishing stone somewhere on the bank of the Mississippi.
And if I kissed it... and made a wish... it'd come true.
What was the wish?
Sure was a good dinner, Mrs. Rudd.
Just our usual.
Christian, help your mother with the dishes.
May still be some in that drawer over there.
I don't know how good they are.
Now you can show Papa some of them tricks.
- Tricks?
Pick a card, Mr. Rudd.
Any card you want.
Three of hearts.
Damnedest thing I ever did see.
Hey, you gotta come in and see this one.
Come on, Mama.
Now, you look good.
Don't show it to me.
The three of spades.
Are you playing tonight or just dealing?
- Are you playing tonight?
- Yes, I'm playing tonight.
- I'll win something.
Don't you worry about it.
Twenty-five years.
I've been building a reputation for 25 years.
- My honesty, integrity...
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not gonna give him any help unless he needs it.
Good old honest Shooter.
You know, you remind me more and more of my first husband.
- He was a loser too.
- Well, I'm no loser.
The Kid could break lucky and stay ahead the whole game, couldn't he?
Well, it could happen, couldn't it?
Sure it could happen.
Take me around the block a couple of times.
You did tell the Kid 8:00, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Well?
Hello, everybody.
- Lady!
- Piggy, Pig, Pig.
Doctor.
Oh, how lovely.
You know the missus.
- Hello there.
- Mrs. Hoban.
My pleasure, Lady Fingers.
You don't get around these parts much anymore.
That's true.
I suppose it's more a matter of climate than anything else.
No other reason?
- What other reason could there be?
- The Cincinnati Kid.
Should I be?
Hey, Kid.
He's here.
Damn right.
Hello, Yeller.
Kill that cat, Kid.
Well, I'm feeling great.
- And it's good to see you again.
Well...
Lancey Howard.
I'm glad to know you, Lancey.
My pleasure.
How the town treating you?
New Orleans always been good to me.
Well, that's fine.
Of course, towns do change, though, don't they?
They tell me you're quite a stud player, young man.
New York, Chicago, Miami.
Oh, I've been hearing about you for a couple of years now.
Yeller there tells me how you gutted him once with a pair of fours.
That's right.
Must have overplayed my hand.
Well, that's a dangerous thing to do.
Well, it depends who you're sitting with, Lancey.
They come from the New Orleans Bridge Club... and they've been bonded by the steward.
I seen him take them right out of the safe himself.
And Shooter, Lady Fingers and me just carried them right here.
If it's proved a deck's been juiced, he pays off the losers.
Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc Sokal.
Sure, sure.
Now, Kid, what's your game?
Stud poker.
Gentlemen... if there are no objections, I'm the dealer.
All right.
These rooms have been contracted for, the ante will be $10 per chair per day.
I'm sorry to hear that, Lady Fingers.
You know how much I enjoy your high style of playing.
You got a lot of style yourself, Lancey.
Thank you.
Let's hope it holds out.
Gentlemen, this game is five-card stud poker.
You can check and raise.
A dead man has one half-hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.
- Ten dollars.
- Call the sawbuck.
- I'll play.
- I'm in.
Pair of nines.
Deuce.
Pair of nines bets.
- Double sawbuck.
- I don't chase the nines.
Hold.
I fold.
Queen, four, 10, king, king... and an ace to the man.
Ace bets $25.
And I can't get started.
Call.
Keep dealing.
King folds.
Did you see that?
Shooter folded a king.
Shooter knows what he's doing.
He's a percentage player.
That right, Melba?
That's what they say, Mr. Slade.
Well, he'd better be if he's gonna remain anything at all.
- Ten's bet.
- Hundred.
Came here to play.
- I'm in.
- Fold.
- Two and a half.
Make it 500 and see you both run.
- Another 200.
Thousand.
Two thou...?
- I'm 2000 light.
- No, you're not.
I'll try it.
Five thousand to you, Pig.
Well, that's pretty sweet.
I jack it up and get whipped on both sides.
Lancey?
New deck, please.
He don't chase the Kid nowhere.
Read them and weep, boys.
Aces up.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Absolutely hilarious.
- What's the action?
Well, the Kid hit him once, and he ain't come back yet.
- He'll take out Pig first.
- King bets.
- I'm in.
Pair of jacks.
Ten.
Jack to the king.
Seven to the queen.
Pair of jacks bets.
Pair of jacks will venture $100.
Also.
Man, I'm outside.
I'll up it 200.
Lancey could be laying for him with three jacks.
I'm sticking.
Ten to the jacks.
Possible straight.
Pair of sevens.
Check those sevens.
Likewise.
I'll... bet the size of the pot.
Call the 980.
Doc...
I'll play.
Trey to the jacks.
Busted.
No straight, no flush.
Nine to the sevens.
Jacks bet.
Check.
Pair of sevens says...
Pair of sevens says 1500 bucks.
I'll call your 1500 and raise you... 2500.
Twenty-five to you, Pig.
I haven't got it.
How much have you got?
Eleven hundred.
All right.
Then we'll make it 1100.
Five... 10, 14.
Eleven hundred to you, Pig.
Take it easy, Pig.
Deal me out.
You let him fake you out.
Thanks, Lancey.
Thanks a lot.
Not very lucky, is he?
He never has been.
Yeah, let's go a little while.
Thank you kindly, Melba.
Thank you, dear.
You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance... of next week's income.
- I know what you mean, Mr. Slade.
- Don't you find that kind of disturbing?
- Say, Hoban...
- And Spider Man died kind of slow.
First they took a kidney, then a gallbladder... and then they took his whole damn stomach.
You remember Spider Man, don't you?
- He died kind of slow.
- Good crowd.
- Yeah.
You know, Kid... you're the best stud-poker player I've seen in 35 years of action.
Thank you, Lancey.
You know, that was a sweet thing you did to the Pig with those jacks.
You saw that coming, did you?
Yeah, I saw it coming.
Before I raised?
I saw it coming, Lancey.
You ever play down Miami?
- Not yet.
You ought to come down sometime.
- I might do that.
- Gotta have good nerves, though.
You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action... day in and day out.
Unless your nerves can hold.
How are yours, Kid?
They've been worse.
No.
Well, don't you have a girl?
Yeah, well, she's out of town right now.
No unpleasantness, I hope.
Just tie into something nice when you're away from the action... and let it wear itself out.
- Right with you, Shooter.
Well, I'm glad we had this little chat.
Yeah, that's right, Lancey.
Regardless.
Well, cheers.
It's a whole new deal.
You haven't lost your touch, Lady Fingers.
- He's a little younger than you, isn't he?
- Just deal, Lady Fingers.
A deuce to the man.
Trey.
Busted.
Ace-queen bets...
What's in the pot?
Four-twenty.
It's yours, Shooter.
Hoban?
You mind shutting those drapes?
Well, that makes me about even, gentlemen.
In a game like this, that's a smart place to quit.
Ace-king bets.
One moment, please.
Nine hundred and thirty.
You and that damn book.
What are you writing in that book, Sokal?
Nine-thirty to you, Lancey.
What have you got?
It doesn't matter.
If you can call, you can beat.
Ace, king, seven.
Ace, king, 10.
How about that mess.
I had them both beat with a pair of fives.
What do you keep betting out for?
He shouldn't have, eh?
Better write yourself a new book, daddy.
I'll settle for the 1700 that I've already lost.
Later.
Gentlemen, I, too, will withdraw.
Well... just the two of us, Kid.
Deal them up, Shooter.
Cost you a grand.
Compulsory call, Kid.
Kings up.
Last card.
Nine to the kings.
Ace.
Pair of aces bets.
Bet the pot, 2700.
- Two thousand.
- Call.
Last card.
Three sevens.
Two pair, 10s and sixes.
Take it, Lancey.
I can't beat three sevens.
