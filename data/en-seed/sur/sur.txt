What then?
You won't believe this.
A horse-ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac... and an uncle!
They told me you had a wine cellar, but I didn't believe it.
What do you mean, call?
This is a surprise.
How the hell did you know I didn't have the king or the ace?
What happened?
Why don't you just go?
Are you crazy?
What happened to your coat?
He's alive!
Would you really wear a thing like that?
Those girls! Wild drivers, sports cars!
I never mentioned any illness.
Oh! Sorry. You made me jump.
You got our package back, man.
And I was with some boys in the neighborhood, and we saw this and went, "Oh, My God!"
What are they doing here?
- But I want to know why.
Where's your uniform?
He'll take care of your mortgage.
What's the idea of turning her down?
- I wonder what he's doing with Mr Cluett.
What's the matter with my policy?
Where's all the money today?
I must have been crazy.
Well, look who's here.
What a man!
What happened?
I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
- Matt, you must be mistaken.
Can you imagine that guy?
He was here?
Heavens' name!
What's got into you?
What do you mean, there's no more money?
You won't believe it until you see it.
- You're not beginning that again, are you?
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies.
- Do I look like a baroness?
- Is this the time, or I am blind?
Madame is canceling the engagement?
Your hands are sunburned, aren't they?
What on earth have they been doing to you?
You could love me?
- Really?
Don't you understand?
Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
- I thought it was all over.
- All that money, Baron?
I don't believe it.
Doesn't a doctor have to do that?
Why, if it isn't our friend the sharpshooter.
Why are you laughing?
Don't I know you?
There are you, free to come and go as you please, and you choose to stay here.
But who would buy the boat?
Why did you do it, Andy?
What's going on between you two?
What sort of a man are you?
- What happened in church?
I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing.
My word, are there important people downstairs?
Case, it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this.
- Don't you believe it.
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
Aren't you tired, Melanie?
Why aren't you helping Melly with my surprise birthday party?
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.
If I'd only known, I'd have come straight home.
When did you discover that?
- You knew that too?
Never, in any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.
- Who are you calling this late?
- What's Taylor got to do with this?
Two whole days!
What did he bring his pigeons for?
- What happened to him?
Say, wait a minute.
- Do I actually see this?
- Did you want to see me?
- How did this happen?
- That's the boy wonder?
Daniel Webster sat here?
- Who let you in?
- Why aren't you chasing ambulances?
Didn't you talk about a boys camp?
- Senator Paine decided this with you?
How big is this thing?
- You've always had to work?
Look, money!
- She wants to talk to me?
Holy mackerel.
Did you think I was a lady?
He didn't say anything about a dam.
- You won't stand for it?
You tell these men and Senator Paine what to do?
- This doesn't make sense.
I was amazed at his violent reaction until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 acres.
Why isn't he at his desk?
- One man muzzling a whole state?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades?
Don't you find that restful?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with them.
But why do you bring this up now?
Alexis, do you know what you're saying?
- Did I hear something about jewels?
Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news.
But how can there be a question?
Why are you so good to us?
Don't we like Leon?
Leon, why are you so good to us?
It must have been here all day.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
You didn't get legal advice?
Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time?
- In other words, you don't know?
- Pardon me, are you an explorer?
